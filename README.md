To integrate tailwindcss with rails simply create a new project with the css flag:
"rails new app_name --css tailwindcss"

Then to run "./bin/dev" to launch development server.
If on windows use "ruby ./bin/dev", most files will require you to add "ruby" infront of it.

This project was to try to integrate tailwinds with rails.

Deployment instructions
* use "rails server -p 3000" to run rails server
* then "rails tailwindcss:watch" to compile the css files

I have not gotten the javascript to work as yet
